# PyBer Analysis
Throughout this module we have been analyzing data for a ride-sharing company called PyBer. We were provided two files that we based our analysis on:
1. The first data set contains the cities along with their driver count and type (Urban, Suburban, or Rural):
   [City Data](https://github.com/haldud/pyber-analysis/blob/66698e262ebf800fcbeb70d7546f48cc3330381d/Resources/city_data.csv)
2. The second data set contains all of the unique ride data that contains the unique ride id, fare amount, and city:
   [Ride Data](https://github.com/haldud/pyber-analysis/blob/66698e262ebf800fcbeb70d7546f48cc3330381d/Resources/ride_data.csv)

## Overview
For our challenge, we were given a new assignment to analyze data by city type. We used Pandas and Motplotlib to combine the data from the city and ride data files.

For part 1 of our challenge, we identified the following statistics by city type:
- Total Rides
- Total Drivers
- Total Fares
- Average Fare per Ride
- Average Fare per Driver

For part 2, we combined the usage of several features within Pandas and Matplotlib to generate a multiple-line graph to show weekly fares by city type. This allows us to quickly identify the differences between the city types over the first few months of 2019.
